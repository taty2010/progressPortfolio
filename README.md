## Portfolio
This is my current portfolio that I am using to show the work I have done to reach my goal of becoming a Front End Developer. I hope to constantly update this website the more I learn and to make sure my code is up to standard. 

## Motivation
This website was created as a part of an assignment from Skillcrush at the end of my web development course. I wanted to make sure that the website represented who I am and that I could actually use it as a porfolio page and not just to complete an assignment.
